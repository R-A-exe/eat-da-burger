## Usage

Open the [website](https://gentle-spire-36270.herokuapp.com), you will find two columns of entries:

- Left side: burgers that have not yet been devoured, and have a 'Devour' button next to them;
- Right side: burgers that have been devoured.

Type-in the description of a burger, then click 'Submit'. The burger will be added to the database, and the page will refresh to reflect the change. You will see the burger on the left side of the page, with a 'Devour' button.

When clicked, the 'Devour' button will change a status field of the burger in the database, and reload the page; the devoured burger now appears on the right side.
